In this framework i have automate the website of amazon.in and make the framework on add the iphonepro 15 pro max into the cart button.
I have created the maven project for this framework and added the all updated necessary dependencies.
After complete installation i got main two files src/main/java and src/test/java
In src/main/java i have created main two packages base class and page object model, in base class we wrte the code for the initilization of driver and in page object class i have found out the x-path for our necessary actions
In src/test/java i have created step defination file is for writing of our steps for automation also i have created file is featurefile and one class in cucumber option is test runner it is used for the running of our test cases.
while creating this framework i have used the concepts of java like data abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism,and inheritance
I'm requesting to the HR team please see the framework and if there is any mistakes happened from me then please let me know  then definately i will correct those mistakes and resubmit to your team.
